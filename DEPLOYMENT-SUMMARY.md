# Deployment Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. BMad Chat Interface Fixes
- **Issue**: Cursor focus was not automatically returning to the text input after sending messages
- **Solution**: Replaced `requestAnimationFrame` with `setTimeout` for better focus restoration reliability
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/chat/page.tsx`
- **Lines**: 1392-1395, 1598-1601, 1652-1655

### 2. Icon Standardization
- **Issue**: Settings and theme toggle icons were smaller than other UI elements
- **Solution**: Increased icon sizes from `w-4 h-4` to `w-5 h-5` and adjusted button containers from `h-9 w-9` to `h-10 w-10`
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/chat/page.tsx`
- **Visual Consistency**: All icons now have uniform sizing across the interface

### 3. Quality Compliance Dashboard

- **Features**:
  - Authentication system with Supabase
  - Real-time KPI dashboard with compliance metrics
  - CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Actions) tracking

  - Document upload and management system
  - Training completion monitoring
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
